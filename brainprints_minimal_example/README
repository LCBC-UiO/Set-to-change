             INITIAL FREESURFER ANALYSIS
#####################################################

requirements: 
FreeSurfer 7.3.2 run w/expert options found in file "global-expert-options.txt" (see FREESURFER-NOTES below)
If running fssubregions-part, need to use singularity + freesurfer_7.3.2.sif image (can be downloaded from freesurfer repo)
    + need to bind patched files (see FREESURFER-NOTES below + comments in fs_subregions.sh)
    
order:
1) submit_freesurfer-default.sh
2) submit_freesurfer-base.sh # depends on 1) so run this first
3) submit_freesurfer-long.sh # depends on 2) so run this first
4) submit_samseg.sh # depends on 3) so run this first
5) submit_fssubregions.sh # depends on 3) so run this first

remember to update paths

             BRAINPRINT ANALYSES (PYTHON)
#####################################################

requirements:
Python 3.10.4
and packages found in requirements_py3.txt

brainprints_analysis_minimalexample.py contains instructions to get started
the program also calls helpers_brainprints.py and helpers_similaritycalc.py so they typically have to be located in the same folder as the main script

PATCH:
mri_sclimbic_seg --> mri_sclimbic_seq_patched (search for MHS)

PATCH:
mri_sclimbic_seg --> core.py --> core_patched_MHS.py (search for MHS).
important that import is 
from freesurfer import samseg
from freesurfer.subregions import utils
and not what the official FS patch suggest due to wrong calling of GEMS in the official one

Re: [Freesurfer] 7.1 require experts opts for hires?

You should not need to increase the the number of iterations. Most of the problems with the hi-res stream was due to the extra vertices. The new stream decimates the mesh down to the number of vertices that would have been in a 1mm scan.

PARALLEL-FLAG
Parallel-flag broken in 7.3.2. 
https://www.mail-archive.com/freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/msg68920.html
Solution: run without

T2PIAL AND LONG-STREAM
 # T2pial in long-stream (not sure if this is relvant - it concerns the base stream):
 https://www.mail-archive.com/freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/msg49858.html
 "you need to use the existing transforms from the base (when the T1 template 
get’s created) and apply these to the co-registered T2 of each time point. In 
recon-all base code you will find a mi_robust_template call that takes existing 
lta transforms for each time points and simply create an new template (based on 
the inputs) without actually registering (—inform and some other flag to avoid 
iteration). I think the orig.mgz in the base was created this way. You would 
run a similar command on the T2’s of each time point."

SOLUTION (see freesurfer_long.sh):
# NOTE: important to use the raw T2 from the default stream as the long-stream automatically will 
# load and apply the .ltas coregistering this to default-orig.mgz + to base template. If not using 
# T2raw (ie. using something further down the pipeline, data would potentially get coreg transformation applied twice)
